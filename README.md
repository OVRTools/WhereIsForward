# Where Is Forward?

This is a very, very, _very_ simple OpenVR overlay that literally just puts an arrow in the center of your play area that faces the front of it. No longer will you be lost in your Actual Reality while in your Virtual Reality.

## FAQ

### Where get?

[Here](https://github.com/tjhorner/WhereIsForward/releases)

You might need the [.NET Core Desktop Runtime](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/1b3a8899-127a-4465-a3c2-7ce5e4feb07b/1e153ad470768baa40ed3f57e6e7a9d8/windowsdesktop-runtime-5.0.0-win-x64.exe) if you don't already have it. (Or you can download the self-contained version instead, which includes the .NET Core runtime.)

### Why?

[See this answer in video form](https://twitter.com/tjhorner/status/1329667055478566915)

SteamVR provides an arrow facing forward, but only when there is no Scene application running. I don't know why they just don't show it while the Dashboard is open. But that's what they did. So this will show it no matter what you are doing!
